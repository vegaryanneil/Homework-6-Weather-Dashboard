# Weather Dashboard

![ExampleOfDashboard](assets/ExampleofWeatherDashboard.png)

## Description
This project is a weather dashboard that utilizes a weather API from Open Weather Map. Users are able to search a city or country and get weather information. Weather Information includes Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, and UV Index.

I had to do calculations to convert the some of these variables into US Units.
